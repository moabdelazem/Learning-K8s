# This file contains a pod definition that creates a pod named multi-pod with two containers.
# The first container runs the nginx:1.14.2 image and listens on port 80 for incoming traffic.
# The second container runs the busybox image and executes the command echo Hello Kubernetes From Mo! && sleep 3600. The pod is created in the default namespace.
